## Introduction

HealthBot is a Telegram chatbot built with Python, utilizing the Telegram Bot API and NLP techniques to provide personalized health information. It aims to answer health-related queries, offer guidance on well-being, and connect users with healthcare resources. The bot can assist with general topics such as fitness, nutrition, mental health, symptoms, and more. 

## Features

- **Health Queries**: Answer questions about general health, symptoms, and wellness.
- **NLP-Powered**: Uses Natural Language Processing to understand user questions.
- **Interactive Responses**: Engages users with personalized responses and health advice based on the users' queries.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ugochi-okafor/cudos-health-chatbot/
cd healthbot
```

### Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set Up Telegram Bot Token
- Create a new bot with BotFather on Telegram.
- Get the token and store it securely.
- Create a .env file in the root directory and add your bot token:

```bash
TELEGRAM_API_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here
```

## Usage
Once you've set up the bot, you can start it by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

The bot will start interacting with users on Telegram.

## How It Works

HealthBot works by using the Telegram Bot API to receive user input, process the query using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and then provide relevant information. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the bot operates:

1. **User Input**: Users send a message or command to the bot.
2. **Message Processing**: The message is converted into an embedding, which is a rich representation of a text document.
3. **Response Generation**: The bot retrieves the relevant document, either from the medical vector databases or generates a response using an LLM (e.g., GPT).
4. **Response Delivery**: The bot sends back the processed response to the user on Telegram.

This architecture ensures that the bot can handle a wide variety of health-related queries in real-time.

## Creating Virtual Machine

<b> Step 1:</b> Create a new GPU instance

<b> Step 2:</b> Select an Instance with a GPU

<b> Step 3:</b> Create an SSH public key using the following command

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f C:\Users\USER\.ssh\vm_key.pub
```

### Step 4: Copy the key

```bash
cat C:\Users\USER\.ssh\vm_key.pub
```

### Step 5: Paste the key

### Step 6: Deploy the instance

## Deploying the Model

### Step 1: Copy the IP Address of the Created Virtual Machine

### Step 2: Login to the Virtual Machine

```bash
ssh -i path_to_key root@IP_Address
```

### Step 3: Update the Virtual Machine

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Step 4: Clone the GitHub Repository

```bash
git clone repo_path  # Update with the actual repository path
```

### Step 5: Install pip

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

### Step 6: Install the requirements.txt file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 7: Create and Upload the .env File

```bash
nano .env
```

### Step 8: Paste .env File Content

```plaintext
HF_TOKEN=
BOT_TOKEN=
```

### Step 9: Run the Main File

```bash
python3 main.py
