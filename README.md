## How It Works
HealthBot works by using the Telegram Bot API to receive user input, process the query using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and then provide relevant information. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the bot operates:

1. User Input: Users send a message or command to the bot.
2. Message Processing: The message given is converted into embedding. WHich is a rich representation of a text document. 
3. Response Generation: The bot retrieves the relevant docuemnt, either from the medical vector databases, or generates a response using an LLM (e.g., GPT).
4. Response Delivery: The bot sends back the processed response to the user on Telegram.

This architecture ensures that the bot can handle a wide variety of health-related queries in real-time.
